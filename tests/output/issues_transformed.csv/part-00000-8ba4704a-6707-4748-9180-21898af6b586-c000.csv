I know it's a tough issue and while I don't expect it to be fully resolved because of this, now or ever, you do need to report when it's getting out of hand. 

I walk my dog through this park, today is probably my last day doing so. There's human fecal matter in various spots all the time. The droves of bugs that eat it then when you unknowingly walk near it/them swarm is startling. 

While that's not great the last straw happened today when some homeless guy went after my toy poodle. Some other, random homeless guy said my toy poodle was cute, great, whatever, no problem there, but then another guy from street heard it and started b-lining it towards my dog. As I reeled her in on the leash his path curved to always be heading towards her. It got to the point where I fully reeled her in and picked her up leaving me facing some tweaked out homeless dude looking somewhat deranged blocking my path of walking forward. I asked him what he wanted somewhat sternly (of course it's a little jarring when someone walks swiftly at your small dog) and got no response. He didn't move or anything just stared at me, I started to walk around him and he blocked my path. Not wanting any of that I turned around, dog in hand, and left the way I came in.

Once again, I'm not expecting homelessness to be solved or anything, but you have to report when it's crossed lines, and not being able to walk through a public park without a homeless guy going after your stuff/ clearly menacing/ intimidating/ stopping you from walking forward is clearly crossing the line.

Can we station an officer here or something? It's clearly a problem area that I'm sure you guys are aware of. Sleeping on the sidewalk/ that gazebo thing, not great, but at least not causing too too much trouble (too bad people can't really use that park), confronting people actively... that needs to be stomped out immediately. I know it comes in waves with some times being more controlled and better than others. It seems where in a bad spot and I ask that we step it back to at least get it to an inconvenient but tolerable level.

I'm 32 and eventually have to make a decision about what/ where is best for me and my family, homeless people taking over and incidences of them going after the things I care about make it an unfortunate but pretty simple decision. I like Ft Lauderdale in general and hope we can get this back under control.",26.1216518563375,-80.1426094758059,"15 Se 1st St Fort Lauderdale, FL, 33301, USA",https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/17398561,Registered User,Police Department,Homeless Concern,false,1,2024-08-29
